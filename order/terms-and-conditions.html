              <h4>Terms & Conditions</h4>
                    <p>The following terms and conditions apply to projects undertaken by The Web Mastro</p>
              </div>
               <div class="term-text">
                  <h3>Revision Policy</h3>
                  <p>Revisions are contingent on the package select. Clients can approach us for unlimited free amendments and we will revise their design with no extra charges, given that the design and concept remain intact. Revision turnaround time will be 48 hours.</p>

<!-- <p>*Unlimited revisions require that the initial design and concept have to be the same, customer cannot ask for a redesign once an initial concept has been selected.</p> -->
<h3>Refund Policy</h3>
<p>In any occasion, any funds deposited will not be liable for a refund if the initial design and concepts (after delivery) are approved, or a change is asked for unless The Web Mastro cancels or ends your Contract for a reason other than your breach or non-execution.</p>
<p>All requests for refund will be as per the following arrangement:</p>
<p>You make a solicitation when the underlying ideas for a logo are provided. However once you approve or ask for changes in the initial designs, the refund offer will be void and a request for refund will not be entertained.</p>
<p>Once the project has been entered in revision phase,&nbsp;the refund offer will be void and a request for refund will not be entertained.</p>
<p>On the off chance that demand for refund is made before the delivery of initial design concepts, then you would qualify for a full refund (less 10% administration and preparing charge).</p>
<p>If the refund request is made within 48 hours, you will only be eligible for a 66% refund (less 10% administration and preparing expense).</p>
<p>If the refund request is made within 48-96 hours after the initial design delivery, you will only be eligible for a 33% refund (less 10% service &amp; processing free).</p>
<p>No refund request will be entertained after 96&nbsp;hours of the initial design delivery. However, we believe in 100% customer satisfaction so you are requested to reach out to us so we can address your concerns.</p>
<p>No request for refund will be entertained after inaction by the customer after 7 working&nbsp;days. If you wish to restart the order, you will be charged a certain fee contingent upon your venture.</p>
<p>No request for refund will be entertained if the customer goes unresponsive at any point of time for 5 working days.</p>
<p>All refund request should be made to the support department. The Web Mastro reserves the right to approve/reject any and all refund requests based on an individual case to case premise.</p>
<p>No refund will be entertained after the final files have been delivered.</p>
<p>For Website bundles, no refund will be entertained once the initial design mock up has been revised
or the inner pages have been created with client's approval.</p> 
<p>All requests for refund must be communicated to the support department. The Web Mastro, in light of the infringement of your user agreement reserves all authority to affirm/object your solicitation on an individual case to case premise.</p>
<p>For The Web Mastro/Custom bundles, refund will be apply just the same as on the single packages.</p>
<p>For instance, in the event that you request for a logo and web design and approve of the logo, you are eligible for the refund of the website service at the time of initial design only.</p>
<p>A refund request should have a legitimate reason which must be qualified against the outline brief and client input for revisions. Unless an idea has not been composed as per brief, a refund will not be approved however discount won’t be given however further revisions will be provided until you are satisfied.</p>
<p>It is also to be noted that, under any circumstances, both parties (The Web Mastro &amp; Client) agree not to attack/criticize each other and any of its employee, associate/s or partner/s publicly (on public forums, blogs, social networks etc.) at any given time during or subsequent to contract period. Similarly both parties agree not to talk on forums, blogs, community groups or any social media in a way which brings bad name to either party or any of its employee, associate or partner. In case of breach, the breaching party would have to pay a reasonable compensation decided by the non-breaching party as damages.</p>
<p>Money Back Guarantee depends on that the request is set in accordance with some basic honesty. Where a client has placed design orders with more than one agency for the same job, with the intention of claiming a refund, The Web Mastro does not consider this to be good faith. In such instances, we reserve the right to decline a refund request.</p>
<p>All design jobs require client input before finishing the design which is why it is requested that the customer is active throughout the process and gives feedback in order to get the required results.</p>
<p>100% unique design guarantee qualifies you for a new logo if the logo designed by The Web Mastro is found to be considerably similar to another design that already exists. Any likeness to a current outline will be just a fortuitous event and The Web Mastro won’t acknowledge any responsibility or claim of any compensation in such a case. It is the client’s responsibility to get their artwork copyrighted.</p>
